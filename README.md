# RoboND-Digits-Inference
This is a Udacity Robotic Software Engineer Nanodegree Project. 
NVIDIA’s DIGITS workflow to rapidly prototype ideas that can be deployed on the Jetson in close to real time.With DIGITS, you’ll prototype classification networks, detection networks, segmentation networks and even more!


## Writeup

The entire project is explained in this [writeup](https://github.com/Amay22/RoboND-Digits-Inference/blob/master/Robotic_Inference.pdf).
